# hsStore-API
My first REST.API created to fetch in my React Eccomerce project deployed with HerokuApp.

For this project im using:
    - Node.JS
    - Express
    - CORS
    - Dotenv
    
    - MongoDB and mongoose to handle the dataBase

Feel free to use it if you need. It was only created for academic purposes: https://radiant-river-14751.herokuapp.com/api/products
